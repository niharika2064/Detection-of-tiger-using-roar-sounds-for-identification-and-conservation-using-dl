Aim of our project :Wild animals are very important in terms of nature and forest department staff who safe guards those animals plays a important role too. In present days wild-life monitoring and classifying animals has more significance as they are getting endangered as we are moving ahead. So here comes a wild animal classification using a model which would be trained on the sounds of those animals, this helps the staff of forest department to be cautious and also monitor the animals location using the sounds and distinguish which animals are present in the surroundings.
The ability to recognize and classify sounds is a fundamental task for both humans and machines. In the animal kingdom, different species are known for their distinct vocalizations and sounds, which often play a crucial role in communication, mating, and survival. This project delves into the realm of using deep learning techniques to classify animal sounds based on their unique audio features. By harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we aim to develop accurate models that can differentiate between the sounds of different animals.
